[11-10-16][Rane]: Started working on this project again, simply because it is an unfinished project. The learning experience should be beneficial, even if it turns out different than originally expected. Today I moved the states into their own folder, packaged the assets within the .jar file export, and created a simple menu button.

[6-29-2016][Rane]: Created the workspace and synced it with GitHub. Added BroManSalaam as a contributer. The next step forward is to add a Graphics updating class. I also think that reviewing good programming habits and the process that is taken to commit a change should be addressed. (i.e. create a seperate branch, make the changes for that branch, submit a pull request, have your changes reviewed by at LEAST ONE other contributer before pulling and merging the branch with the master.
